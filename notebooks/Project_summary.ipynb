        "**Potential issues:**\n",
        "\n",
        "• All tests were performed based on the presence and severity of clinical symptoms – an issue with the study in itself – not applicable to asymptomatic patients but still generalisable for those presenting symptoms.\n",
        "\n",
        "• All tests performed based on the risk of complications if infected – not sure if this means only looking at those more at risk - could be a biased sample if so, relationship between symptoms and positive result might be different in different demographic/risk groups\n",
        "\n",
        "• All the symptoms were self-reported – inconsistency. Individual differences in symptom reporting. What one person might define as a headache, sore throat etc might be different to another person.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Symptom reporting was more comprehensive among those who tested positive for COVID-19\n",
        "\n",
        "• Potential for an underestimation and underreporting of symptoms among those who tested negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Missing data - for patients labelled as having had contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19, additional information such as the duration and location (indoors/outdoors) of the contact was not available.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Some symptoms e.g. lack of smell and taste, were identified as being very predictive of a COVID-19 infection by previous studies but were not recorded in this dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "• A negative value for a symptom might mean that the symptom was not reported, not that they didn’t have it\n",
        "\n",
        "• Biased features - (headache 96.2%, sore throat 92.3% and shortness of breath 92.4%) and symptoms with balanced reporting (cough 27.4% and fever 45.9%).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Proposed solutions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Missing values:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Check model performance when considering values as unreported or missing vs performance when considering them as negative\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*Biased features:*\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Try training and testing the model while filtering out symptoms of high bias in advance \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Data exploration - feature values:**\n",
        "*   Numerical features often are a mix of strings and ints - need to do conversions\n",
        "*   'None' values are also often strings - need to convert to actual NULL values\n",
        "*   Categorical variables need to be encoded via e.g. OneHotEncoder\n",

        "\n",
        "*   Most classes are imbalanced except for \"gender\"\n",

        "*   High number of none values for the following: “age_60_and_above” and possibly “gender”.\n",
        "*   It is essential to keep the None value for “age_60_and_above” as it has the highest count. \n",
